<H4><B>NAME</B></H4>
<PRE>       reglookup - windows NT+ registry reader/lookup tool

</PRE>
<H4><B>SYNOPSIS</B></H4>
<PRE>       reglookup [options] <U>registry-file</U>

</PRE>
<H4><B>DESCRIPTION</B></H4>
<PRE>       reglookup  is designed to read windows registry elements and print them
       out to stdout in a CSV-like format. It has filtering options to  narrow
       the  focus of the output. This tool is designed to work with on windows
       NT/2K/XP/2K3 registries, though your mileage may vary.

</PRE>
<H4><B>OPTIONS</B></H4>
<PRE>       reglookup accepts the following parameters:

       <B>-p</B> <U>prefix-filter</U>
              Specify a  path  prefix  filter.  Only  keys/values  under  this
              registry path will be output.

       <B>-t</B> <U>type-filter</U>
              Specify  a  type filter. Only elements which match this registry
              data type will be printed.  Acceptable  values  are:  NONE,  SZ,
              EXPAND_SZ,  BINARY,  DWORD, DWORD_BE, LINK, MULTI_SZ, RSRC_LIST,
              RSRC_DESC, RSRC_REQ_LIST, QWORD and KEY

       <B>-h</B>     Enables the printing of a column header row. (default)

       <B>-H</B>     Disables the printing of a column header row.

       <B>-s</B>     Adds four additional columns to  output  containing  information
              from  key  security  descriptors. The columns are: owner, group,
              sacl, dacl.  (This feature’s output probably contains bugs right
              now.)

       <B>-S</B>     Disables   the  printing  of  security  descriptor  information.
              (default)

       <B>-v</B>     Verbose output. (Currently does little to nothing.)

       <U>registry-file</U>
              Required argument. Specifies the location of the  registry  file
              to  read.  Typically,  these  files  will  be  found  on  a NTFS
              partition under %SystemRoot%/system32/config.

</PRE>
<H4><B>OUTPUT</B></H4>
<PRE>       reglookup generates comma-separated values (CSV)  and  writes  them  to
       stdout.  The format is designed to simplify parsing algorithms of other
       tools by quoting CSV special  characters  using  a  common  hexadecimal
       format.   Specifically,  special  characters  or  non-ascii  bytes  are
       converted to "\xQQ" where QQ is the hexadecimal value for the byte.

       The number of columns or fields in each line is fixed for a  given  run
       of  the  program,  but  may  vary  based  on  the  command line options
       provided.  See the header line for  information  on  which  fields  are
       available and what they contain.

       Some  fields  in  some  lines  may  contain  sub-fields  which  require
       additional  delimiters.  If  these  sub-delimiters   occur   in   these
       sub-fields,  they  are  also encoded in the same way as commas or other
       special characters are.  Currently, the second, third, and fourth level
       delimiters  are "|", ":", and " ", respectively. These are particularly
       important to take note of when security attributes are printed.  Please
       note   that   these  delimiters  may  occur  in  fields  that  are  not
       sub-delimited, and should not be interpreted as special.

       Security attributes of registry keys have a complex structure which  is
       outlined  here.  Each key will generally have an associated ACL (Access
       Control List), which is made up of ACEs (Access Control Entries).  Each
       ACE  is  delimited by the secondary delimiter mentioned above, "|". The
       fields within an ACE are delimited by the third-level  delimiter,  ":",
       and consist of a SID, the ACE type (ALLOW, DENY, etc), a list of access
       rights, and a list of flags. The last two fields are delimited  by  the
       fourth-level delimiter " ". These final lists are simply human-readable
       interpretations of bits. The access  rights  abbreviations  are  listed
       below along with their Microsoft-assigned names:

             QRY_VAL       KEY_QUERY_VALUE
             SET_VAL       KEY_SET_VALUE
             CREATE_KEY    KEY_CREATE_SUB_KEY
             ENUM_KEYS          KEY_ENUMERATE_SUB_KEYS
             NOTIFY        KEY_NOTIFY
             CREATE_LNK    KEY_CREATE_LINK
             WOW64_64      KEY_WOW64_64KEY
             WOW64_32      KEY_WOW64_32KEY
             DELETE        DELETE
             R_CONT        READ_CONTROL
             W_DAC         WRITE_DAC
             W_OWNER       WRITE_OWNER
             SYNC          SYNCHRONIZE
             SYS_SEC       ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY
             MAX_ALLWD          MAXIMUM_ALLOWED
             GEN_A         GENERIC_ALL
             GEN_X         GENERIC_EXECUTE
             GEN_W         GENERIC_WRITE
             GEN_R         GENERIC_READ

       And the meaning of each flag is:

             OI  Object Inherit
             CI  Container Inherit
             NP  Non-Propagate
             IO  Inherit Only
             IA  Inherited ACE

       Please see the following references for more information:

               <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms724878.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/ms724878.aspx</A>
               <A href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa374892.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa374892.aspx</A>

       Note  that some of the bits listed above have either not been allocated
       by Microsoft, or simply aren’t documented. If any bits are set  in  the
       above  two  fields that aren’t recognized, a hexidecimal representation
       of all of these mystery bits  will  be  included  in  the  output.  For
       instance,  if  the  lowest bit and third lowest bit were not recognized
       while being set, the number "0x5" would be included as  an  element  in
       the list.

       While  the  ACL/ACE output format is mostly stable at this point, minor
       changes may be introduced in future versions.

<H4><B>EXAMPLES</B></H4>
<PRE>       To read and print the contents of an entire system registry file:

            reglookup /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system

       To limit the output to just those entries under the Services key:

            reglookup -p /ControlSet002/Services /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system

       To limit the output to all registry values of type BINARY:

            reglookup -t BINARY /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system

       And to limit the output to BINARY values under the Services key:

            reglookup -t BINARY -p /ControlSet002/Services /mnt/win/c/WINNT/system32/config/system

</PRE>
<H4><B>BUGS</B></H4>
<PRE>       This program has only been tested on a few different systems.   (Please
       report  results  to  the  development list if you test it on Windows NT
       4.0, 2003, or Vista  registries.  Also,  if  you  test  on  any  64-bit
       architecture, please contact us.)

       Verbose output is not working.

       The SID conversions haven’t been carefully checked for accuracy.

       The   MTIME   conversions  appear  correctly  produce  the  stored  UTC
       timestamp.  However, due to the periodicity of registry writes, and the
       complexity  of the conversion, a small amount of error (on the order of
       seconds) may be  possible.  The  documentation  available  online  from
       Microsoft on this field is very poor.

       Backslashes  are  currently  considered  special  characters,  to  make
       parsing easier for automated tools. However, this causes  paths  to  be
       difficult to read.

       You’ll   notice  that  registry  paths  aren’t  all  the  same  as  the
       equivalents you see in the windows registry  editor.  This  is  because
       Windows constructs the registry view from multiple registry files, each
       with their own roots. This utility merely shows  what  exists  under  a
       single  root.  This  isn’t really a bug, but one should be aware of the
       differences in path.

<PRE>       This program was initially based on editreg.c by Richard Sharpe. It has
       since  been  rewritten  to  use  a  modified version the regfio library
       written by Gerald Carter. Heavy modifications to the  library  and  the
       original command line interface have been done by Timothy D. Morgan.
